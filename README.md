General information 
Coin quest is a cooperative two player game developed in MakeCode Arcade (Python) for the woring with Data and Code (52685) subject at the University of Technology Sydney. The aim is simple, both players must collect all of their coloured coins, avoid the lose tiles and reach the win tile before the timer runs out. The project demonstartes the use of loops, variables and event driven lofic to create interactive gameplay. Originally designed as a dog vs cat chase game, it was redesigned into a coin collecting challenge after peer feedback from Angeline, who suggested keeping both sprites visible on screen. This feedback led to maijor improvements in camera tracking, sprite management and gameplay clarity. 
purpose: the game demonstrates how coding principles translate into user interaction, data tracking and cooperative system design. 
Problem it solves: 
It encourages players to work togther while exploring structured coding logic. 

Technology Used
- MakeCode Arcade (Python variant)
- Python 3 syntax
- SpriteKind events and Tilemap API's
External learning Sources
- MakeCode Arcade Python Coin Collection Tutorial
- Sprite Overlap and Game Design Tutorial
- Python Recap - LinedIn Learning
- MakeCode Forum
- Miscrosoft MakeCode



Features
- Two player cooperative controls
- Independent camera tracking for both sprites
- Automatic coin generation using FOR loops
- Real-time score and countdown timer
- Win and lose condition based on tile overlap
- Event driven interactions and sound effects
- Fair and cooperative win requirement

Usage
PLayer control two human sprites 
PLayer 1 (girl): IJKL 
PLayer 2 (boy): Arrows 
Gameplay Flow: 
- Move around using seperate controller keys

Project Status 
Completed - Final version submitted for A2: Working with Data and Code. The game functions fully with all key logic and event systems in place 

Room for Improvement 
Improvements to be made: 
- Add shared camera view for both players
- Include animations for win/lose screens
- Add dynamic background music
Future features:
- Online multiplayer support
- Power ups or obstacles to increase challenge
